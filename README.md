# Server-cleaner
an automation project used to clean servers of unimportant disk consuming files. best used for old logs, cache etc...

the single folder cleaner branch was created to provide a solution for cases where just one specific folder needs to be cleaned.
it is built with a Tkinter Gui in which you must provide the folder location in the server/endpoint.
like the main branch it will only clean files older then 21 days (the number of days could be changed if needed)
