# Server-cleaner
an automation project used to clean servers of unimportant disk consuming files. best used for old log directories, cache's etc...

the main branch includes a "Closed" Tkinter Gui which allows the user to choose which server\directory to be cleaned. 
all files older then 21 days will be deleted from the location (the number of days could be changed if needed).

***obviously the server names in the file are in my own environment and will need to be changed as needed. 

***requirements: install and import the following python libraries: os, datetime, tkinter.

***note the code contains images which are attached as separate files, they need to be saved in the same directory as the .py file

other versions and solutions of this project are available in other branches.
